// * Problem 1
// whatIsThis('hello', 'world');
// * "this" is ...    Window Object
// * because ...      Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of this inside of that function will be the window object.





// * Problem 2
// window.whatIsThis('hello', 'world');
// * "this" is ...    Window Object
// * because ...      This is implicitely bound to the window, but the terminal does not have a browser, so it will through an error.





// * Problem 3
// inAnObject.test1('face', 'book');
// * "this" is ...    the inAnObject obj
// * because ...      Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is bound to this






// * Problem 4
// inAnObject.anotherObject.test1('twitter', 'book');
// * "this" is ...    an Error
// * because ...      There is no test1 method in the anotherObject




// * Problem 5
// inAnObject.anotherObject.test2('twitter', 'book');
// * "this" is ...    anotherObject
// * because ...      When a function is called (in this case test2), by a preceding dot, the object before 
//                    that dot (in this case anotherObject) is "this."




// * Problem 6
// whatIsThis.call();
// * "this" is ...    Window
// * because ...      When you use call, "this" will usually be applied to the first parameter. 
//                    Since this has no parameter, it will be applied to the "whatIsThis" function, which makes 'this' the window object





// * Problem 7
// whatIsThis.call(trickyTricky);
// * "this" is ...    trickyTricky Object
// * because ...      Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined as the trickyTricky obj
//                    




// * Problem 8
// whatIsThis.call(trickyTricky, 'nice', 'job');
// * "this" is ...    trickyTricky Object
// * because ...      'this' is bound to the first parameter. The additional parameters will be used as arguments for the whatIsThis function




// * Problem 9
// whatIsThis.call(confusing);
// * "this" is ...    confusing object
// * because ...      Similar to the above, call explicitly defines 'this' to the passed in object




// * Problem 10
// whatIsThis.call(confusing, 'hello');
// * "this" is ...    confusing object
// * because ...      Like problem 8, the first parameter is defined as 'this' and the additional parameters are passed
//                    in as the first argument to whatIsThis 




// * Problem 11
// whatIsThis.apply(trickyTricky);
// * "this" is ...    trickyTricky
// * because ...      The 'apply' method works just like 'call' in this situation. Apply will bind to 'this' the first parameter(argument)





// * Problem 12
// whatIsThis.apply(confusing, ['nice', 'job']);
// * "this" is ...    confusing object
// * because ...      Just like above, 'apply' will set the first argument (in this case confusing), to be what this refers to. 
//                    Remember, first parameter in '.apply' = this.
//                    The array is used as the arguments for whatIsThis, so that's why we get a and b logged as nice & job.






// * Problem 13
// whatIsThis.apply(confusing, 'nice', 'job');
// * "this" is ...    Error
// * because ...      Apply needs an array as the second argument. Here's a handy tip to remember that - Apply and Array both start with 'a'!
//                    Both call and apply can be called on functions, which they run in the context of the first argument. 
//                    In call the subsequent arguments are passed in to the function as they are, while apply expects the second argument to 
//                    be an array that it unpacks as arguments for the called function."




// * Problem 14
// inAFunction('what will', 'happen?');
// * "this" is ...    Window
// * because ...      this defaults to the Window because the 'this' that is being logged in the console is coming from the 'whatIsThis' 
//                    function, which is a function in the global scope which is implicitly bound the window object when referring to this.





// * Problem 15
// inAFunction.test3('A', 'B');
// * "this" is ...    Error
// * because ...      No test3 function exists




// * Problem 16
// var newObject = new inAFunction('what will', 'happen?');
// * "this" is ...    Window
// * because ...      The keyword 'new' assigns this to the newObject. When it goes through the whatIsThis in inAFunction, it loses it's 
//                    binding to the new object created because whatIsThis is not declared as a method. It is just a function. So when 
//                    whatIsThis runs, this has no binding, so this defaults to the global value/window object.





// * Problem 17
// var newObject = new inAFunction('what will', 'happen?');
// newObject.test3('C', 'D');
// * "this" is ...    The first reference to 'this' is the window object
//                    The second reference to 'this' refers to the specific object created by the Constructor and is returned by that Constructor
// * because ...      When newObject is created, it inherits the methods of 'inAFunction' and this is bound to newObject.  
//                    inAFunction calls "whatIsThis", and newObject loses it's binding to 'this' just like above because what is this is a function, 
//                    not a method. In the end, 'this'  does NOT have an owner object, so the value is a global value which is the browser window.

//                    The second 'this' is referring to the newObject because we are referencing test 3, which is a method, so newObject does not 
//                    lose it's binding to this!



// * Problem 18
// inAnObject.test1.call(trickyTricky, 'face', 'book');
// * "this" is ...    trickyTricky object
// * because ...      Once again we are using the method 'call' so the first parameter (in this case, trickyTricky), is what 'this' will refer to.





// * Problem 19
// inAnObject.anotherObject.test2.apply(confusing, ['foo', 'bar']);
// * "this" is ...    confusing object
// * because ...      We are using the method 'apply' in which the first parameter (confusing object) is what 'this' will refer to. 
//                    It works because the second parameter is an array!
