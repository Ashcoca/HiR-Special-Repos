# Reference Solutions and Practice Problems

This repository contains reference solutions for certain sprints of the HREXT Hack Reactor
Extended program.

Additionally, in the Toy Problems folder there are practice problems for certain foundational
concepts such as the keyword 'this', closures, and scope. These problems have a full test
suite and SpecRunner so that students can ensure their solutions are fully workable.

Good luck!
